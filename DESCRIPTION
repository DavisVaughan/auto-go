Description: Auto-GO is a framework that enables automated, high quality Gene Ontology enrichment analyses visualizations. It also features a handy wrapper for Differential Expression analysis around the DESeq2 package (Love et. al 2014) and a handy wrapper around the single-sample implementation of the GSEA algorithm (ssGSEA), useful for low-numerosity transcriptional profiles. The whole framework is structured in different, independent functions, in order to let the user decide which steps of the analysis perform and which plot to produce.
